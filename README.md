# Mining-College-Subreddits-for-Unique-Disclosure
QTM 340 Final Project taught by Dr. Klein. Project team members: Minh-Thy Tyler and Dani Roytburg
Apologies for the messy code. This project uses sentiment analysis and topic modeling to analyize the college subreddits of Georgia State, John Hopkins, Emory, and Georgia Tech
We created our own dataset by scraping the subreddits, but it was too big to upload to GitHub :(
